testDeleteTodosNotRelatedToSpring_usingBDD() : tests the delete method whose return type is void.
	-> when there are no return values for method then how to test.
	-> try using other method in place of times(1), never() ... 
	
24 Step 06 : BDD (Behaviour driven development):	

	// Given
	
	// When
	
	// Then     [at 7:00]
	
	
25 Step 07 : Verify calls on Mocks : 
   -> can check how many times a method will be called 
   -> times(), never(), atLeast(n).
   
   	verify(todoServiceMock, times(1)).deleteTodo("Learn to Dance");// check other methods like times(1) atLeast
   	

27. Step 09 : Hamcrest Matchers
	-> explore
		-> other methods in the class.
	
28. Step 10 : Mockito Annotations - @Mock, @InjectMocks, @RunWith, @Captor..	

29. Step 11 : Mockito Junit Rule
	-> not much clear about how and why to use Rule vs RunWith
	
30. Step 12 : Real world Mockito Example with Spring	
	-> there is good learning in this project, Captor and all.
	-> test of the methods which return type is void.
		-> if the method dont have any call to the mocked object method then how to verify ?
